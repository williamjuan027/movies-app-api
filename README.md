# Movies App API (Chameleon ðŸ¦Ž)

> This is an API for the [Nativescript Movies App]()

This API lets you transform the app into anything you come up with (hence then name Chameleon ðŸ¦Ž). The App is driven entirely by an external API for its contents and styling.

// TODO: add a demo of what it looks like

## How it works?

// TODO: do we need this?

## Want to see the App with a different content?

Maybe you want to transform the app into an ecommerce app that sells furniture? or maybe a sporting goods app?

You can do all that by modifying the data files here.

// TODO: add files here and instructions

The app has an option to point to a custom url. You can fork this repo and point the app to your repo

> See this on url (add some notes on how the url should look)

If you want your content to show up in the list of contents in the app, open a PR to this repo and add your new content in the [`data/data.json`]().

## Want to see the App in a different style?

Think about this like creating a skin or a theme. Get creative and add your own styles (maybe a neon one or grayscale, hmm).

Similar to how adding a content works, the app has an option to point to a custom url. You can fork this repo and point the app to your repo with the modified styles.

If you want your fancy new styles to show up in the list in the app, open a PR to this repo and add your new styles in [`styles/styles.json`]().
